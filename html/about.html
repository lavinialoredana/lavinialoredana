            <h1> Product Designer</h1>

            <p>
                I am a former Public Relations Specialist for/within The Austrian Embassy / Ministry for Foreign Affairs
                of Austria who walked away from the Cultural Field to fresh start a career of changing the world trough
                empathy and functional digital experiences as a product designer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interested in covering the entire digital product design process for both websites and mobile apps,
                including brand and visual communication, user experience design and user interface design. I like
                building new products from scratch or optimizing existing ones so they perform better from both a user
                and business perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
                While merging two of my passions—technology and culture I believe in collaboration over competition
                because it’s all about enjoying the ride.
            </p>

                THANKS FOR STOPPING BY!
